전반적으로 깔끔하고 넓어서 친구들과 며칠 보내기에 좋은 숙소였던 것 같습니다ㅎㅎ 다만 겨울철에 난방이 너무 안올라서 조금 고생했던 부분 외에는 흠잡을 데 없이 좋았습니다!! 지하철역과도 굉장히 가깝고 편의점도 근처에 있어서 너무 편하게 묵고 갔어요!
"사진과 함께 설명이 되어있어 찾기 쉽고, 숙소가 깔끔하게 정돈되어 있습니다. 지하철역과 가깝고 상가가 많아 위치도 훌륭합니다. 궁금한 점이 있을때도 호스트가 적극적으로 도와주십니다^^"
"The place is really spacious and comfortable, everything is really convenient, the design and setting are really cozy, the location is really nice. Would definitely recommend"
交通很方便 。民宿老板人很好
Irin is so helpful and nice. She recommended me lot of good place and provided informative advice. I enjoyed the trip and the living experience. Highly recommended!
It is very clean and well-kept house. Convenient as it is near to a station and quite a few eating places nearby.
"Irin is an amazing host, ensuring a welcoming and comfortable stay. She is always available to assist with any questions or concerns, providing excellent recommendations for local dining and attractions. The location is incredibly convenient, being just a short walk from the train station, which makes getting around the city effortless."
숙소가 역과 가깝고 인근에 편의점 식당 마트등이 있어 지내기 좋았습니다 숙소에 비품이 잘 준비되어 있고 깔끔하고 조용한 숙소였어요 호스트의 피드백은 빠르고 정확합니다 다음에도 또 이용하고 싶습니다!!!! 잘 지내고 가요~~^^
"호스트분도 너무 친절하시고, 지하철 역과도 가깝고 깨끗하고 넓은 편안한 숙소에서 좋은시간 보냈습니다! 다음에 오면 또 머무르고 싶은 공간이네요"
"아이린님의 따뜻한 숙소에서 서울 여행 잘 즐기고 갑니다 ^^ 정말 친절하시고, 메세지 답도 빨리 주셔서 서울 여행을 하는 분들에게 적극 추천합니다. 종로구까지도 가깝고, 혜화나 대학로도 구경하기 좋습니다. 밤이 되면 한적해지는 동네이기 때문에 소음이 전혀 없고 쾌적했습니다. 편안하고 깔끔한 인테리어와 가구들이 있어 매우 편리합니다. 주방에서는 요리를 해먹을 수도 있으며 도구들이 전부 제공됩니다. (충전기를 두고왔는데 숙소에 있어서 정말 럭키! ^^) 나중에 또오고싶은 숙소입니다~"
숙소가 너무 깨끗하고 지하철과 거리가 가까워서 이동이 편했습니다. 어린 자녀들이 집처럼 편해서 호텔보다 좋았다고 하네요~^^ 다음 서울 여행 때도 이용할 예정입니다~
"Irin의 숙소는 매우 쾌적하고 넓고 아늑했습니다. (1-2명의 투숙객은 1개의 침실만 예약하여 이용하는 것도 가능하다고 합니다. 다음에 또 기회가 있다면 그렇게 이용해보려 해요^^) 숙소 주변은 조용하면서도, 근처에 예쁜 한옥 카페나 공원, 산책로가 있어서 즐길 거리가 많았습니다. 덕분에 여행을 알차게 보낼 수 있었어요."
"숙소가 넓고 깨끗해요! 침구들이 다 새삥 느낌 화장실도 넓었고, 사용하진 않았지만 방에 세탁기 건조기도 있더라구요 근처에 예쁜 한옥카페들이 많아서 좋아요 친구랑 셋이 배달음식 시켜먹고 잘 놀다 갑니다~~"
집이 넓고 깔끔해 가족들과 편하게 머물렀어요. 주위에 맛있는 한식집이랑 분위기 좋은 카페도 있어 좋았습니다. 다음에 서울 여행 올 때 다시 예약 드릴게요. 감사합니다.
Irin and her home are lovely. Had an amazing stay!
"Nice place to stay. The location is near to metro station, and there is elevator at the nearest exit which very important if you take a large luggage. The house is as the description and the photo showing here. If you walk around the blocks nearby, you could explore coffee shops, restaurants, fashion stores etc. 离地铁口很近，最近的地铁出口是有电梯的。房间描述和照片与实际一致。如果去周边小巷里走一走你会发现很多餐馆咖啡馆时装店等。"
"I had a great time in seoul thanks to Irin and her apartment! The house is close to the subway and there are many good restaurants in the neighborhood. The apartments themselves look great! Very bright and nice space, the room was clean and cozy. Irin was very responsive and agreed to rearrange the furniture in the room according to my wishes. The mattress was very comfortable and the blanket was very warm! Irin also gave recommendations for good places to go, showed me around and was just incredibly nice and kind! I recommend this place to everyone! If I ever plan a trip to Seoul again, I will definitely stay here again!"
"Irin is a great host! She is very friendly, and was always responsive through messages and always happy to answer any questions I had about the accommodation or neighbourhood. Her place had everything as advertised and it is also in an extremely convenient location with plenty of places to eat, convenience stores, and the Hansung subway station is also just a (approx.) 3 minute walk away. She was very hospitable and I always felt comfortable during my stay, and I would not hesitate to book with her again for future trips to Seoul and I would definitely recommend her place to solo female travellers!"
"Loved staying at Irin's place. It was spacious and clean, and as described. Close to the train station too! She was also very welcoming and friendly, and knows a lot about the area. Would definitely come again."
The house owner is a very kind person. She introduced a lot of interesting places to us. We become a very good friend during the trip. The room is very clean and cozy. And this room has a better deal compare with the other rooms. Wish we can stay longer in Seoul.
"My stay with Irin was delightful! Her place is close to the bus and subway, as well as restaurants and cafes. It is amazingly quiet even though it’s on a main road. Irin provided personalized recommendations of places to go sightseeing for me. She was always available to answer questions too. She is a wonderful host and I hope to stay with her again!"
"Irin was very helpful with the stay, showed me around her local area and had many things in line for great visits if you visiting Korea. She was very responsive throughout the booking process and made things smooth as butter. I would highly recommend her as a host and her place for a stay. If I were to visit Korea again, I would reach out and book this place to stay."
